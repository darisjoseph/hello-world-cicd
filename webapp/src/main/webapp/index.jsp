<h1> Hello, Welcome to Simple DevOps Project !!   </h1>
<h2> Deploying on a kubernetes using ansible for Valaxy Technologies </h2>
<h2> Glad to see you here </h2>

<h2> I'm very happy to have gone this far. </h2>

<h2> It is not easy but eventually my love Alma and I will get there. </h2>

<h2> I set up Poll SCM on Jenkins and I am adding this line so Jenkins will automatically<br>
	build the job, then create an image from the job and a container from the image</h2>

<h2> This is another test to see if adding this sentence to the code will trigger Jenkins to build <br>
	the job after the change, then Ansible will deploy the artifact to create an image, then a container</h2>
